# Dev Container Docker Compose Configuration for Ruby on Rails with PostgreSQL
# This configuration has been optimized for reliability in automated and remote environments

services:
  app:
    build:
      context: ..
      dockerfile: .devcontainer/Dockerfile

    volumes:
      - ../..:/workspaces:cached

    # Overrides default command so things don't shut down after the process ends.
    command: sleep infinity

    # Database connection string for Rails applications
    # Provides a standard way to connect to the PostgreSQL database
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/postgres"

   # Use proper Docker networking (not network_mode) to avoid namespace issues and ensure reliable container startup across environments
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy # Wait for PostgreSQL to be ready before starting the app
    networks:
      - app-network # Connect to custom bridge network for service communication
    # Use "forwardPorts" in **devcontainer.json** to forward an app port locally.
    # (Adding the "ports" property to this file will not forward from a Codespace.)

  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - app-network # Connect to the same network as the app container

    # Health check ensures PostgreSQL is ready before dependent services start
    # This is critical for depends_on with condition: service_healthy to work properly
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres" ]
      interval: 10s # Check every 10 seconds
      timeout: 5s # Wait up to 5 seconds for response
      retries: 5 # Retry 5 times before marking as unhealthy
      start_period: 30s # Give PostgreSQL 30 seconds to start before health checks begin
    volumes:
      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql
      - ./create-db-user.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/create-db-user.sql
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      # Your config/database.yml should use the user and password you set here,
      # and host "db" (as that's the name of this service). You can use whatever
      # database name you want. Use `bin/rails db:prepare` to create the database.
      #
      # Example:
      #
      #  development:
      #    <<: *default
      #    host: db
      #    username: postgres
      #    password: postgres
      #    database: myapp_development
      #
      #  ...
      #
      #  test:
      #    <<: *default
      #    host: db
      #    username: postgres
      #    password: postgres
      #    database: myapp_test

    # Add "forwardPorts": ["5432"] to **devcontainer.json** to forward PostgreSQL locally.
    # (Adding the "ports" property to this file will not forward from a Codespace.)

# Persistent storage for PostgreSQL data
volumes:
  postgres-data:
    # Named volume ensures data persists across container restarts
    # Located at /var/lib/postgresql/data inside the container

# Custom bridge network for service communication  
# Replaces the problematic network_mode: service:db approach
networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge # Standard bridge driver for container-to-container communication
    # Services on this network can communicate using service names (app -> db)
